description: Now, fellows, what are we goin' to do this vacation? demanded Cub Perry
  as he leaned back in his upholstered reed rocker and hoisted his size 8 shoes onto
  the foot of his bedstead. "School's all over, we've all passed our exams, and now
  we've got a long vacation before us with nothing to do. It's up to yo-uns to map
  out a program." "Why can't you help map it out?" asked Bud Taylor with something
  of a challenge in his voice. "You always have the last word?" "Cub's the dictator
  of our outfit, and we do the work, that's why," declared Hal Stone. "We always have
  to listen to him, you know that, Bud. So what's the use o' kickin'?" "Oh, I'm not
  kickin'," Bud replied. "It's no use. Cub 'u'd drown us out with his voice if we
  hollered. You know you made 'im admit once that noise was the only thing that 'u'd
  convince him." "You c'n change that now and call it static instead of noise since
  we've all become radio experts," smirked Cub with characteristic superiority. "Ha,
  ha," laughed Bud.
